Data Science in Python Final Project

This colab notebook follows my path in learning data analytics and machine learning using python and the popular California Housing dataset. 

I got experience in navigating python's data analytics library, pandas. There is work with histograms, scatterplots, and adjusting the dataset. 
I moved onto making predictions with multiple regressors, such as XGBoost, and focused on scoring metrics, where I used cross-validation and hypertuning.
